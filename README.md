Breast Cancer Prediction with Supervised Machine Learning
Project Overview
Breast cancer is a significant health concern with far-reaching social and economic implications. Accurate prediction and early detection are crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing the overall impact of the disease. This project aims to develop a supervised machine learning model for breast cancer prediction, specifically differentiating between benign and malignant cases using pathological data.

Objectives
Enhance Medical Diagnosis: Provide accurate and early predictions to enhance medical diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.

Data-Driven Insights: Utilize data-driven insights to facilitate early personalized treatment choices, contributing to better overall healthcare strategies.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle, specifically the 'TFUG Prayagraj Breast Cancer Diagnosis' competition. It contains pathological data related to breast cancer cell samples, making it suitable for the project's objective.
